In the realm of finance, the stock market stands out as a highly unpredictable domain, influenced by a multitude of factors and a vast array of investors, buyers, and sellers. The endeavor to predict stock market movements has been a prominent pursuit ever since the integration of machine learning into financial analysis. However, despite the advancements, only a handful of techniques have proven effective in forecasting stock market trends due to the market's ever-changing nature.

Recognizing the pivotal role of time in stock market dynamics, Time Series (TS) analysis emerges as a potent tool for short-term stock market prediction. The initial step in this analytical process involves assessing whether historical stock market data exhibits stationarity. This is achieved through techniques like Plotting Rolling Statistics and the Dickey-Fuller Test, which help identify patterns and trends within the data.

To enhance the accuracy of predictions, it becomes imperative to eliminate inherent trends and seasonality within the data, transforming it into a stationary series. This preparatory step ensures that the subsequent analysis is focused on the underlying patterns rather than external influences.

At the heart of Time Series analysis lies the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, renowned for its efficiency in capturing intricate patterns within financial data. Leveraging a combination of autoregressive, integrated, and moving average components, ARIMA provides a comprehensive understanding of short-term stock market behavior. To delve even deeper into the nuances of the data, ARIMA is further dissected into three subclasses: Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA). These subclasses enable a nuanced comparison of their individual predictive capabilities, aiding in the selection of the most effective model for specific market conditions.

The culmination of this rigorous analysis yields forecasted values, offering glimpses into the future movements of the stock market. However, these values are initially represented within the context of the stationary series. To make these predictions more accessible and applicable, they undergo a transformation process. Trend and seasonality constraints, initially removed for analysis, are meticulously applied back to the forecasted values. This final step ensures that the predictions align with the natural patterns of the stock market, providing actionable insights for investors, buyers, and sellers navigating the complex and ever-changing financial landscape.
